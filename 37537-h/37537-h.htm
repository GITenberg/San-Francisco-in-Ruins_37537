<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By A. M. Allison</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="dropfig"><img src="images/img002.jpg" alt="T" /></span>he historians of modern or ancient times have never recorded such a
maelstrom of terrified, horror and panic-stricken human beings as awoke to
the realization of the master seismic tremblor, in the City of San
Francisco at 5:13 on the morning of April 18th, 1906. The initial quake,
being followed by many of less severity, tumbled chimneys, large and small
buildings of poor or faulty construction, broke water mains and ruptured
electric light and power conductors, causing many conflagrations in a few
moments. Then followed a catastrophe unparalleled in modern times, a
disaster beside which, for property losses, the Chicago fire, the
Johnstown flood, the Galveston tidal wave, the Mont Pelee eruption,
Vesuvius&#8217; spoutings and the Baltimore fire, fade into infinitesimal
disturbances on the records of Father Time.</p>

<p>In three days, which seemed only as so many hours, there faded out of
existence noble business blocks, grand and imposing structures, beautiful
and superb residences the homes of the Argonauts, the sea kings, mining
barons and merchant princes, together with the marts and dwellings of
those who toil and delve and go down to the sea in ships, completely
desolating and razing by fire three-fourths of this once beautiful
metropolis of the whole Pacific Coast on either the northern or southern
continents.</p>

<p>Nor was the City of San Francisco alone in its extremity, for many smaller
and populous towns within a radius of seventy-five miles were subjected to
the peril of the mighty corkscrew quakings, Santa Rosa being entirely
shaken down; Salinas, San Jose, Palo Alto, Santa Cruz, Berkeley, Alameda
and Oakland all suffering great property losses and some human lives. The
beautiful structures of the Leland Stanford, Jr., University, at Palo
Alto, all erected and endowed to a sum in excess of $40,000,000 by the
late Senator Leland Stanford and his philanthrophic wife, were almost
completely wrecked, including the Memorial Cathedral, which contained the
largest and finest collection of mosaic pictures on the Western
Hemisphere.</p>

<p>At no point in the affected area were the earthquake shocks so severe and
destructive as in the down town district, south of Market and east of
Kearny streets, where were the large office buildings, newspaper offices,
banks, wholesale stores and warehouses, the occupants of which conducted
the business, commerce and financial engagements of not only the major
portion of the Pacific Slope, but a large and constantly-growing Oriental
trade as well. The opportune hour of the morning was all that saved the
lives of the untold thousands who labored there, but had not as yet left
their homes in the residence sections of the ill-fated city.</p>

<p>Hardly had the mighty tremblor ceased its gyrations when innumerable fires
broke out among the chaotic ruins, having caught from engine furnaces,
broken electric wire conduits and spontaneous combustion, fed by the most
inflammable of materials and fanned by a stiff breeze from the bay, grew
and spread into what shortly became the most stupendous and widespread, as
well as awe-inspiring conflagration, which any people of the eighteenth or
nineteenth century have ever as yet looked upon or flown from. Had the
water mains not have been ruptured, the splendid San Francisco fire
department might have been able to cope with these many outbursts of flame
at their inception, but deprived of water in the mains, they nobly fought
the appalling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> flames by pumping water from the bay at as many places as
length of hose and their engines&#8217; ability would permit; but their efforts
to stay the onrushing, wide-spreading flames proved as a match&#8217;s flicker
before a whirlwind.</p>

<p>It being quickly seen that the panic-stricken people would soon become a
fleeing, dazed and terror-awed multitude, General Frederick Funston,
commanding the Department of California, United States Army, with
headquarters at the Presidio, immediately ordered out the cavalry,
infantry and artillery forces under his command, who aided and directed
the fleeing populace, gathered up and succored the wounded, established
emergency hospitals, and policed the city. At the same time
men-of-wars-men from the Mare Island Navy Yard, consisting of the
battleship Ohio, the cruiser Chicago, and the torpedo boat destroyer Paul
Jones, together with the ships of the United States Army Transport
Service, and all available steam craft, attacked the flames along the
water front and succeeded in saving much wharfage and the Ferry building,
which is the principal gateway from the mainland.</p>

<p>Aided, ordered and guarded by the United States Army and Marine forces,
assisted by the California National Guard, who were at once called out by
the Governor, George C. Pardee, the excited and frenzied San Franciscans
made their way to squares, parks and the open hills, over two hundred
thousand fleeing to these places of refuge and another hundred thousand
making their way by ferry-boats and other craft across the bay to the
cities of Berkeley, Oakland and Alameda, caring for naught except to get
away from the awful havoc and destruction of the place they once proudly
called their City.</p>

<p>In untiring efforts to stay the flames the army, navy, marine corps and
police used artillery fire, gun-cotton, dynamite and rhyolite in
back-firing, sacrificing whole blocks of splendid residences and other
structures to retard the unquenchable ever-advancing line of fire, which
at times extended unbroken for over three miles in length. At last, at the
dawn of Saturday, April 21st, after three days and nights of valiant
effort, the wind subsided and the flames died down to rise no more; but
not until after they had swept the once proud and majestic city from the
Ferry building to Van Ness avenue, ruining all the residences on the west
side of that broad, stately boulevard, to Twentieth and Guerrero streets
in the Mission, and from the waters of San Francisco bay to the Golden
Gate itself. Not in all this vast section, measuring over sixteen square
miles, did one single habitation escape the shock of the giant tremblor or
the all-devouring flames, with but a few exceptions, viz.: the United
States Mint, the United States Custom House, the United States Postoffice,
which was damaged one-half a million dollars&#8217; worth by made-land sinking
away from it, the new unfinished newspaper building of the Chronicle, and
the new building of the California Casket Company just erected, but not
wood-finished. Every other building, of whatsoever class, kind or
construction, was tumbled, crumbled, shaken down, or absolutely gutted by
the fierce flames in which granite dissolved to powder and steel beams
melted and buckled like a watch&#8217;s freed mainspring; where cobble-stones
scaled and chipped off and marble slabs disintegrated and became as
bone-dust to the touch.</p>

<p>No computer or statistician lives who could accurately arrive at the
monetary loss, variously estimated at from three hundred and fifty to four
hundred millions of dollars. Nor will the loss of human life ever be
known, said to be from fifteen hundred to two thousand; many more are
known to have perished in the lodging houses and cheaper hotels located in
the district south of Market street, as well as in the poorer districts,
of which no returns will or can ever be made; many identities were lost
both in and out of unidentified graves.</p>

<p>On the cessation of the first quake and the breaking out of the flames all
means of surface transportation was rendered useless, except the
automobile, which did good and swift work in rescuing the wounded and
carrying the living to places of safety, as well as transporting dynamite
and other high explosives to the busy fire-fighters, also rendering
invaluable aid in getting food and water to the refugee camps in the
parks, when the relief trains, so generously and beneficiently forwarded
by all the cities of the land, began to arrive laden with provisions and
clothing for the hungry and the destitute. The sister city, Los Angeles,
which by her nearness was enabled to supply physicians, nurses and medical
supplies, as well as foodstuffs, getting the first relief train to the
stricken city on the night of the first day.</p>

<p>Congress appropriated money, private citizens throughout the broad land
gave of their wealth. Army and navy stores and the cargoes of many
merchantmen in the harbor were all made available, and thus famine and
disease were prevented and lives which would have flickered and then
passed out were saved, encouraged and strengthened for the monumental task
of raising a grander, greater, safer and more beautiful New San Francisco
phoenix-like from the ashes of the City of the Forty-Niners.</p>

<p>These are the words; the pictures tell the tale much better; pictures the
like of which, it is earnestly hoped, will never be presented by any
camera again while the earth rolls around.</p>

THE SALVATION OF A STRICKEN CITY</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="dropfig"><img src="images/img151.jpg" alt="A" /></span>fter the Earth jumped back on its track at 5:13:47 on the morning of
Wednesday, April 18th, 1906, the citizens of San Francisco came down on
their feet in fighting mood, and the success of that fight has aroused the
wonder and admiration of the entire world. Being true sons of their
fathers they showed the thoroughbred strain in time of stress and peril
just as did those fathers before them. There was no denying the fact that
many thought it the end of time, listened for the trumpet of Gabriel to
echo through the crash of worlds, and looked toward the heavens to see the
angel with the flaming sword, but they stood to meet it like men, backed
as they were against the wall. When walls ceased falling and they had
rubbed the dust from their eyes, they found that they still lived; it was
then that they shut their jaws and began to fight. They have been fighting
ever since and will continue to fight until San Francisco shall have been
restored even beyond the dreams of those fathers.</p>

<p>The first effective work began with Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz and the
members of the Police Commission, who had quickly assembled at the Hall of
Justice. It was a time when no man could stop to think twice; immediate
action must be taken; action that must be absolutely correct on the first
thought. The first official action was to send out police to close each
and every saloon.</p>

<p>Everywhere the streets were filled with the debris of fallen walls and
cobwebbed with a tangle of dangling wires, among which half a million of
people stood numb and dazed or groped their way blindly, not knowing where
to go nor what to do. In a dozen widely scattered localities smoke devils
were dancing from roof to roof and people gave way mechanically for the
clanging apparatus rushing wildly to the fires.</p>

<p>In collapsed buildings there were many dead, but &#8220;let the dead care for
the dead;&#8221; there were those yet living pinned under fallen walls and
beams. There were hundreds and hundreds of injured to be succored. There
were hundreds of millions of dollars in shattered banks, the savings of
the people, to be guarded against the time when some men go mad and seize
on the possessions of a neighbor as one crazed brute snaps at another.
That was the situation, in brief, that confronted the Mayor, the Police
Commission and the six hundred policemen of San Francisco, a handful to
cope with disaster by earthquake, fire, and the elements of chaos that a
city of half a million breeds.</p>

<p>The Mayor and the Police Commission had barely entered into conference
when this message came to them from Brigadier General Frederick Funston:
&#8220;Do you need help?&#8221; Did they? &#8220;Yes, send all the troops you can,&#8221; was the
reply dispatched with all the haste of a city&#8217;s need. Then the conference
went on. It was brief. The situation demanded the co-operation of the
entire city.</p>

<p>A Citizens Committee of Safety was hurriedly decided upon, and the Mayor
compiled the following &#8220;Committee of One Hundred&#8221; of the prominent
citizens of the city in all walks of life: Mayor Eugene E Schmitz,
chairman; Rufus P. Jennings, secretary; Frank B. Anderson, Hugo K. Asher,
W. J. Bartnett, Maurice Block, Hugh M. Burke, Albert E. Castle, Arthur H.
Castle, Paul Cowles, H. T. Creswell, Henry J. Crocker, R. A. Crothers, P.

<p>These names with addresses from the City Directory, were at once placed in
the hands of a detail of policemen, a few names to each member of the
squad, with instructions to have the Committee at the Hall of Justice by 3
o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>This work had barely been commenced when the rhythmic tramp, tramp, tramp,
of many feet was heard on the street, as column alter column of the
blue-shirted lads swung by, each carrying a short Krag rifle with a belt
of ball cartridges. Their officers reported to the Chief of Police, who
assigned each a district to patrol and detailed a policeman to guide each
command to its post. No one not on Market Street or in the downtown
district at that time can appreciate the feeling of relief that came over
all as those silent, quiet, business-like boys swung by with the
steadiness and precision of a machine, passing under tottering walls and
entering the danger zone with dynamite and gun-cotton to raze buildings
from the path of the fire.</p>

<p>The deeds of heroism and the courage displayed by regulars, militiamen,
police, firemen, and civilian volunteers on the 18th and 19th will never
be told; they can not be. They were occurring constantly, a dozen in a
block, throughout the city, and there was no time for names or details.
Firemen, regulars, police, and civilian volunteers worked in the heat and
smoke and noxious gases until they were overcome and fell in their tracks.
They were dragged back and others stepped into the breach, to be dragged
back in turn when they fell. Firemen fought with the determination of
despair and cried like children when the failure of water deprived them of
their weapon.</p>

<p>Before the hour set for the meeting of the Citizens&#8217; Committee the entire
city was threatened with destruction. The sky was obscured with a pal of
smoke through which swung the sun like a blood-red ball; great sheets of
flame writhed and swirled through the smoke, and underneath all 300,000
men, women and children fled for their lives, tottering under their most
valuable possessions, while 100,000 more were preparing for flight. That
was the situation when the above named citizens met at the Hall of Justice
at the call of the Mayor at three o&#8217;clock on the afternoon of the 18th.</p>

<p>They assembled first in the office of the Chief of Police, but another
shock threatened to bring the tower down on their heads and drove them to
the office of the central station, in the basement, and it was not long
before they were driven from there to Portsmouth Square. There in the open
air surrounded by thousands of frightened Chinese and residents of the
district, was the seat of municipal government during the late afternoon
and early evening. Then a dynamited building cast its debris of bricks,
mortar and broken glass over the square, and government and advisory
committee hastily adjourned to the Fairmount Hotel on Knob Hill.
Headquarters had been established there but a short time when it was
driven back by the advancing wall of fire and an adjournment was taken
until Thursday morning at 9 o&#8217;clock, to meet at the north end police
station, 1712 Washington street.</p>

<p>When the Mayor, Police Commission and Citizens&#8217; Committee of One Hundred
met Thursday morning, the following sub-committees were appointed and

<p><i>Roofing the Homeless</i> (<i>Sub-committee of Housing the Homeless</i>)&mdash;Fairfax H.
Wheelan, chairman; Miss Katherine Felton, O. K. Cushing, and F. J. Symmes.</p>

<p><i>Press Agent</i>&mdash;I. Choynski, chairman.</p>

<p><i>Drugs and Medical Supplies</i>&mdash;Dr. Harris, chairman; Father O&#8217;Ryan, Judge

Mamlock.</p>

<p><i>Relief of Sick and Wounded</i>&mdash;Miss Katherine Felton, chairman; Mrs. John
F. Merrill, Fairfax H. Wheelan, O. K. Cushing, and Dr. James W. Ward,
sanitation.</p>

<p><i>Relief of Chinese</i>&mdash;Rev. Dr. Filben, chairman.</p>

<p><i>Permanent Location of Chinatown</i>&mdash;Abraham Ruef, chairman; James D.
Phelan, Jeremiah Deneen, Dr. James W. Ward, and Dr. Filben.</p>

<p><i>Restoration and Resumption of Retail Trade</i>&mdash;Geo. W. Wittman, chairman;

<p><i>Auxiliary Fire Committee</i>&mdash;A. W. Wilson, chairman.</p>

<p><i>Restoration of Abbattoirs</i>&mdash;Henry Miller, chairman.</p>

<p><i>History and Statistics</i>&mdash;John S. Drum, chairman; E. F. Moran, secretary;
Richard C. Harrison, and Clement Bennett.</p>

<p><i>Organization of the Wholesalers</i>&mdash;William Babcock, chairman.</p>

<p>Martial law having been declared, one of the first orders of the Citizens&#8217;
Committee was embodied in the first proclamation of the Mayor: &#8220;Troops
and police are authorized to kill on sight any person or persons caught
looting.&#8221; After that there were occasional reports in the burned
districts; they may have been exploding automobile tires&mdash;no one stopped
to inquire. Anyway, there was no further looting.</p>

<p>The sub-committees had barely time to organize when the fire swept over
the hills and they were again driven out. The Mayor issued an order that
all records saved and the municipal government be removed to the Police
Station at Haight and Stanyan Streets, far out by Golden Gate Park, for a
last stand. At the same time he ordered an adjournment of all committees
to Franklin Hall, at the corner of Bush and Fillmore Streets, thus
establishing headquarters as near the fire line as practicable. If burned
out there his orders were for all to rally at the Park Police Station.</p>

<p>That was at noon on Thursday; within thirty hours the Committee had been
organized by men who left their property to destruction and within the
same length of time the committee had been burned out four times and
located the fifth headquarters. The city had been policed by regulars,
militiamen and volunteers, and the most disastrous fire in history was
under control.</p>

<p>The care of the injured, the feeding of the hungry and the housing of the
homeless were the first consideration of the Committees, and for the first
day or two all else was subordinated to these works of mercy.</p>

<p>It will require a large book to tell the details of the work of these
committees, each being aided by hundreds of volunteers. Each member of a
committee being vested with police powers, and automobiles, carriages and
wagons of all kinds were impressed wherever found; their loads were dumped
on the sidewalks and filled with the injured or medical and food supplies,
the vehicles hurried on to destinations named by the committeemen.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which the Committee effected an organization and
relieved the suffering and hunger of nearly 300,000 people is noteworthy.
Changing headquarters five times and organizing and planning as the
members fled along the streets was no easy task, but it was accomplished
and for nearly a week these committees arranged and cared for the homeless
multitude.</p>

<p>The rapidity with which organization was effected and order enforced, is
what amazes the knowing world today. It was done by citizens of San
Francisco, backing up their executive with their lives and their fortunes,
and back of them stood their friends in the breadth and length of these
whole United States. As did the fathers of fifty years ago, so did the
sons of today.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
